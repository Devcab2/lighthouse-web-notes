## Primitive data types

- js has 7 primitive types of data
-boolean
-string
- undefined
- null
- number
- symbol
- bigint

> Everything that isn't a primitive data type is an object?.

> Primimtive types are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after they are created.

> you cant make changes to primitive data types unless you redefine them completely.

> Objects are data structures that allow us to store data and functionality together.
>objects are made up of key/value pairs.
>The key in an oject is always a string (usually)
>The value can be any valid javascript value(primitives, arrays, objects,or functions)
>In arrays, you can use an index to access a value
>if you know the name of the key you can use dot notation

## Passing values to functions


> if the name of the key is dynamic (stored in a variable) use square bracket notation

> Primitive types are passed to function by value. This means that a copy is made and used by a function. The original value is unchanged.

> Objects are passed to functions by reference. This means that internal values of the object can be changed by the function, but the object itself cannot be reassigned.
